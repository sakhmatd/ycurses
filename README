This is the port to D of the header files necessary to
link to ncurses from the D Programming Language.

Note: all of these include imports of the Tango std.
That is deprecated and is scheduled to be removed/moved to it's own folder.

let me repeat. Tango currently only supports D1.
If you use the Tango std, and attempt to use this, it will complain and not compile.
To fix this, simply strip __gshared from all variables in all files.

The changes I have made remove backwards compatibility.

D2 currently utilizes TLS by default in all variables.
TLS is incompatible with interfacing with C

Please also note that you will have unexpected results if you pass any TLS variables
to ncurses.  Most notably is the printing of random characters from printw()

As a result, immutable and __gshared will be indespensable to you.
