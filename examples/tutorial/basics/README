All have been reworked except for simple_key.d, simple_attr.d probably won't work
and mouse_menu.d
the rest should work beautifully.

What none of these explains is how to prevent memory leaks.
D is a Garbage Collected language, and C is not.
D cannot automatically reclaim memory that C has used
since there is no way to tell if C is still using it.

To compile any of these files, copy the file into the module
folder.

you'll need to enable deprecated features since I don't know enough yet
to fix one problem.

example:
	dmd -d acs_vars.d  -L-lncurses
	gdmd -d acs_vars.d -L-lncurses
